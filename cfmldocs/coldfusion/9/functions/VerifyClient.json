As a general rule, use this feature for Ajax requests to the server to perform sensitive actions, such as updating passwords.<br>If you call this function, you must enable client management or session management in your application; otherwise, you do not get an error, but ColdFusion does not verify clients. Use this function only on pages that respond to client-side ColdFusion Ajax features, such as bind expressions. These features include code that correctly sends the security token when needed.<br>","Parameter":[]}
