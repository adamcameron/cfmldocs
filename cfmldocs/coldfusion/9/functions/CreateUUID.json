To a very high degree of certainty, this function returns a unique value; no other invocation on the same or any other system returns the same value.<br>UUIDs are used by distributed computing frameworks, such as DCE\/RPC, COM+, and CORBA. In ColdFusion, you can use UUIDs as primary table keys for applications in which data is stored in shared databases. In such cases, using numeric keys can cause primary-key constraint violations during table merges. Using UUIDs, you can eliminate these violations.<br>","Parameter":[]}
